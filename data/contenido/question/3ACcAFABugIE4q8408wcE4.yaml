      :body: 'Thank you so much for your response Samantha. It seems that your case
        is a little more complicated. If he can not give any proof of continuous residence
        in the US, you guys will have to get married and apply for a green card. The
        only problem will be that he would have to leave the country and wait on his
        home country  for his appointment (and have it on the US consulate). The issue
        would be that he might be punished and he wont be able to come back immediately
        (he could get a punishment of 3-10 years for remaining illegal inside the
        US) unless you file a waiver form  I-601, Application for Waiver of Grounds
        of Inadmissibility. I would recommend you to get in touch with an immigration
        office so they can provide with professional help. Here is the info of one
        closer to you zip location: Catholic Charities of Central Texas - Immigration
        Legal Services (Austin Office). 1625 Rutherford Ln, Bldg A, 2nd Floor, Austin,
        TX. Phone Number: (512) 651-6100. SABEResPODER'
